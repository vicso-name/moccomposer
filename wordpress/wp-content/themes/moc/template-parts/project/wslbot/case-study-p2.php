                        <p class="masters-comment">The chatbot for WSL is probably the coolest bot for surfers ever. Did you see their videos? The process of testing this chatbot was also really awesome. We created the “Name the Wave” game and as QA I had to play the game many times ;) Also we performed usual functional and non-functional testing. We gathered and analyzed data everywhere we could get to prepare for performance and load testing. We were following Facebook Messenger Platform Guidelines and Usability to make the interaction journey with a bot as smooth as possible for users.</p>

        <p class="case-section-text launch-center">WSL chatbot launch has been a huge success with over 4K active users within a week after the release date and 100-140 new users checking out the bot daily. User retention rates are great as well staying at 19.6% on the fifth day of the bot performance.
            Building the WSL chatbot has been a challenging and exciting experience for the MOC chatbot development team. It was released according to schedule and successfully met all objectives. As a result, besides its fresh and cheerful communication style and positive attitude, the WSL chatbot stands out from the crowd with its engaging features.
