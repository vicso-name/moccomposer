        <div class="case-section-text">
            <p>Jonno Boyer-Dry is a 30-year old cancer survivor who was diagnosed with Stage IV Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. He conducted massive research to get the resources that will be useful for cancer patients, caregivers, and family members to start with. The variety of such websites makes it hard to find valued information amongst a noise. There was no centralized place to find the resources. Then the first version of the Cancer Chatbot by CSource appeared.</p>
            <p>We cannot imagine what the patients or family members are dealing with. But we can help, inform and support them, so that what we did. We rebuilt a chatbot for Jonno and his wife, Allison Boyer-Dry’s.</p>

                            To get an answer to a question, users can choose certain themes in the form of quick replies or simply type their queries. Some of the search queries are already set up in the chatbot for user convenience the form of the answers is handy and easy to perceive. Users see all the variants of answers in the form of a gallery.  The cards comprise an image, heading, subtitle and “Read more” button. It redirects users to the source of an answer. Users can also subscribe to their search result and get updates on a certain theme.</p>

Our main aim was to reorganize the structure of the chatbot and solve such issues as UX-dead ends and closed cycles. Initial flow was too difficult to follow. Users used to get lost in the mass of texts and resources and just leave the chatbot. The updated chatbot allows users to skip from one section to another, perceive information with no difficulties and never be left with dead ends. Also, the chatbot provides users with alternatives for further steps that might be interesting. Bot’s  considering the user’s current location, point, and place.</p>
