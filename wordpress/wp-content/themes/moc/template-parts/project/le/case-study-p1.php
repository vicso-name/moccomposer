                    <h2>Business Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Luxury Escapesâ€™ deals are regularly updated and subscribed users are notified via email and additionally re-targeted through Facebook Ads. These tactics brought in low open and engagement rates, so the brand started looking for a less cluttered channel to reach its customers.</p>
                    <p>They wanted to provide personalized notifications, suited to their audience's travel experience, notifying them of the latest and the greatest deals. Furthermore, they wanted to have an engaging experience for users to find their best deals rather than the current cumbersome experience of searching and endless scrolling on their website.</p>

                <p>Master of Code designed, built and launched the Luxury Escapes Messenger Chatbot in February 2019. It allowed users to search deals based on their preferences, book luxurious trips around the world and offered a fun 'Roll the Dice' game. Luxury Escapes, in partnership with Master of Code, rolled out a paid social campaign in line with the launch to offer customers a simpler way to search and book and also aimed to boost sales. With just 5-6 interactions within the chatbot, the bot was able to predict a user's ideal travel preferences and later retarget them with current and upcoming luxury deals.</p>
                <p>In just 3 months since launch, the chatbot generated more than $300,000 of sales revenue from engaging with less than 6,000 users.</p>

            <p>Shortly after the launch of the campaign, Master of Code reviewed the data to analyze users' behavior and experience patterns. From this analysis, we trained the bot to retarget engaged users with new deals that aligned with their interested destinations.</p>
            <p>A comparative study was done to review the open rate of Luxury Escapes promotional emails vs. the Messenger chatbot. While their emails averaged an open rate of 14%, Messenger exceeded expectations and garnered a reply rate of 89% of total retargeted users. </p>

                <p>To further increase user engagement, Master of Code launched two additional chatbot features.</p>
                <p>The first launch was for a random vacation selector called 'Roll the Dice'. The chatbot would suggest a random destination and vacation package to the user. We built Facebook ads that drove traffic directly to the vacation selector. 'Roll the Dice' was played more than 16,800 times during the initial campaign.</p>
                <p>The second feature we created was an Augmented Reality (AR) filter. The AR filter was sent to the users as a retargeted message.</p>

            <h5 class="case-study-subtitle">Live Chat integration using Live Chat Inc.</h5>
            <p>Live Chat Inc.â€™s Facebook Messenger application was not on par with the Facebook API causing us to program a middleware that controlled the inflow and outflow of messages between the chatbot, live chat, and Messenger. It gave us control over the handover protocol, thereby, using different operations like creating a chat, ending chat, etc. at will.</p>
            <h5 class="case-study-subtitle">Personalized retargeting messages</h5>
            <p>The key to personalized retargeting messages was to track user behavior inside the chatbot. So we developed an algorithm that would track every movement of the user inside the bot, the deals they look at and how deep in the flow the users go to. Once we had all the data, we would sort user preferences using different metrics and would retarget the user with a personalized deal that they were most likely to buy.</p>

            <p>As mobile becomes more immersive we saw no sign of conversational commerce slowing down, and a messenger bot on social was a high priority to test and learn how our users behave in this space. With the bot in place, we're able to drive personalized, incremental user engagement on a global scale. The ability to go from zero to thousands of users on a new channel is quite unique, and the retention rate so far is amazing.</p>

        <p class="narrow-paragraph vertical-indents">Master of Code created a conversational solution that Luxury Escapes used to create paid campaigns to drive users to access exclusive deals on the chatbot. Their first social campaign ran for 14 weeks in February 2019, which also included a retargeting strategy using Broadcast Messages. As a result, the chatbot generated more than $300K in its first 3 months of the campaign.</p>

                <span class="cs-description">
                    Small engagement features go a long way in increasing brand authority. â€˜Roll The Diceâ€™, a random vacation selector, garnered so much excitement that it was used more than 16,800 times with the average user using it around 3 times per visit. Ads prompting users to â€˜Roll the Diceâ€™ also had a high conversion rate of 52.63%.

                <span class="cs-description">One of the main use cases for the chatbot is to allow users to find personalized deals faster. We trained the bot to understand inputs such as, 'show deals to Bali', or â€˜show me beach holidaysâ€™ and relevant deals for users to view and add to their cart. The chatbotâ€™s conversation rate was 3x higher than the websiteâ€™s, soaring to a rate of 12%. This meant every 9th user who used the chatbot to find the deal ended up making a purchase.
